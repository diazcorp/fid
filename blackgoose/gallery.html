<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare
   with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.

   not used that day are donated to the local food shelter

   People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind out own locally-sourced
