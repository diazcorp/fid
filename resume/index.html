  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>To start this off, I would like to say that my socials usernames are not racist, I am in fact South Korean<br>
     as well as Puerto Rican! I moved to the states when I was three years old and began my American dream. Ever<br>
     since I was a wee little boy I loved creating pieces with what I could find, from blocks to wooden train sets.<br>
     As time went on I began to focus more on drawings, from simple doodles bored at school to sketches in notebooks.<br>
     I developed a liking for art and was determined to find a profession where I could use my artisitic abilities.<br>
     That leaves us to the present, where I take time to pratice what I have learned while mkaing time for family,<br>
     friends, and personal well being.

  <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
  <p>Now I dont have a great lists from accomplishments, I was never the smartest in class, or did houndreds of hours<br>
     in community service, but there are a few that I am proud of.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Certified in Office software such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Access</li>
    <li>Above a 4.0 GPA for all my years in public school</li>
    <li>Served in a technical position for my Church since my 8th grade year</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Like I said it's not many and quite random, however I do feel that I am a fast learner and willing to take the time<br>
     to master anything that leads me to my future goals.

  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>I got my first Job in August of 2021 working as an employee at a Poke restuarant. It taught me the basics of customer<br>
     service and how to manage supplies. As of making this I am yet to work at Universal, but working there won't be as much<br>
     of a difference. I am more looking foward to an intership into graphic design or animation to begin getting expierence<br>
     in working in such a career.

  <h2>Art Works</h2>
  <p>Here I have various works of art that I have created, from sketches to digital art pieces. If I wanna begin a future<br>
     career in animation I have to understand the basics of art and how to apply it digitally.
